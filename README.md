# Cyberbullying-Detection
This system is equipped with features that collectively analyze online content for potential instances of cyberbullying. It employs offensive language density, sentiment analysis, and severity assessment to provide a holistic approach to identifying and addressing cyberbullying. The system's first feature focuses on quantifying the intensity of offensive language within a text. It calculates the density of offensive words, providing a normalized measure that captures the proportion of offensive language relative to the overall content. The second feature involves sentiment analysis, gauging the emotional tone expressed in a text. This helps distinguish positive or negative sentiment, aiding in the identification of potential cyberbullying. Lastly, the system assesses the severity of offensive language by utilizing a supplementary dataset associating a severity score with each offensive word. This allows for a nuanced evaluation of the potential harm conveyed by the usage of offensive language.
Additionally, the system incorporates demographic classifiers to categorize cyberbullying based on various factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.
